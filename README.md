# Ml-model-stochastic-gradient-descent
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a powerful optimization technique that iteratively updates model parameters based on the gradient of the loss function computed for individual training examples. Unlike batch gradient descent, which processes all data points in each iteration, SGD introduces randomness and efficiency by updating parameters more frequently with smaller, randomly selected subsets of data. This approach is particularly beneficial for large-scale datasets and online learning scenarios where processing entire datasets in each iteration is impractical. SGD's stochastic nature allows it to navigate complex, high-dimensional parameter spaces more effectively, often leading to faster convergence and better performance in training machine learning models. Understanding SGD enhances my proficiency in optimizing models efficiently and adapting to dynamic data environments.
